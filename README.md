-⚡ Fun fact: When I was a kid, during school breaks, I managed to solve a 4x4 Rubik's Cube without a YouTube tutorial—just using my knowledge of the 3x3 Rubik's Cube and the rule that repeating a pattern eventually restores the original state. I can also juggle three balls and perform yo-yo tricks!
